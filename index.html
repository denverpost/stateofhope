		<p class="blurb">Hundreds of families have moved to Colorado in hopes of healing their sick children &mdash; kids conventional medicine has failed. They&rsquo;re turning to a liquid form of marijuana that has helped some, but not all. This is the story of 12-year-old Preston and his mother, Ana.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
	<div class="large-9 large-centered medium-11 medium-centered small-12 columns">
		<p class="lead">Ana Watson looks across the living room of the Colorado Springs house that still doesn&rsquo;t feel quite like home and sees her son, Preston, sitting stiffly on a brand-new couch. His eyelids flutter, struggling against the seizures that have quaked through his brain every day since he was 3 months old.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We have a special squirt-squirt we need to do, OK?&rdquo; Ana tells Preston, adopting a smile as she walks toward him. &ldquo;You need to be a big boy.&rdquo;</p>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="large-12 large-centered medium-12 medium-centered small-12 columns">

					<p class="caption"><span class="captionhed">July 12 </span>Ana Watson measures 0.5mg per pound of body weight for Preston&rsquo;s first dose of &ldquo;Haleigh&rsquo;s Hope,&rdquo; a high-CBD oil she has been pinning her hopes on to help control his seizures and change his life.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>In her hand, Ana holds the first dose of what she hopes will finally stop the seizures. More than a dozen medicines have already failed, and continuing down the certain path of conventional treatments promises only more misery and maybe even death for Preston. So Ana has chosen uncertainty in the form of this amber <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip tip-top radius" title="A marijuana extract rich in cannabinoids. Made by dissolving the cannabinoids from marijuana buds and leaves, then diluting the resulting slurry in cooking oil. CBD is generally given to kids in Colorado as an oil.">oil</span> created in a Boulder County garage.</p>
		<p>Just to get to this moment in July, she had to uproot her family and move across the country from North Carolina to Colorado, one of the few places where the new and unregulated treatment is at least somewhat legal. She&rsquo;s committing a federal crime just for trying.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Open up,&rdquo; Ana coos.</p>
		<p>Instead, Preston turns his head side to side to avoid the dropper. Squirming on the couch next to his mother, he&rsquo;s nearly as tall as she is. But hundreds of seizures a day have restrained his development to that of a 2-year-old. He is 12 years old, yet in many ways he&rsquo;s a 70-pound toddler.</p>
		<p>Ana grabs his arm, but he pushes her back. She tackles him and squirts the oil into his mouth, but he coughs it back up. She reaches for her cellphone.</p>
		<div class="row">

				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>&ldquo;Help,&rdquo; Ana writes in a Facebook message to the community of parents who have tried the same treatment. &ldquo;He is spitting it out and gagging. Can I mix it with food, give rectal? Any suggestions?????&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Ana&rsquo;s mom, Milly, stirs more medicine into ice cream and brings it over. But Preston won&rsquo;t eat.</p>
		<p>Ana tries to bribe him with his favorite YouTube videos &mdash; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll press play if you take a bite.&rdquo; He still refuses.</p>
		<p>She promises him that his little sister, Sydney, will dance if he takes his medicine. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not doing it,&rdquo; Sydney says.</p>
		<p>Ana&rsquo;s shoulders slump, and Milly tells her to back off.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re overdoing it,&rdquo; Milly admonishes. &ldquo;Skipping it is not going to hurt him.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>But Ana&rsquo;s jaw clenches.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Why did we even come down here if he&rsquo;s not going to take it!?&rdquo; she snaps.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t force him to take it!&rdquo; Milly shouts.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;He needs to learn to take it!&rdquo; Ana says.</p>
		<p>Milly walks out of the room, saying they should try later.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Stop arguing with me!&rdquo; Ana finally says. &ldquo;Damn.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>She turns toward Preston, and, as if he senses the tension, the cringe on his face pivots into an awkward smile. He starts to laugh, and she does, too.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Silly mommy,&rdquo; he says quietly.</p>
		<p>Ana eventually calls a friend, who suggests giving the medicine in emptied pill capsules delivered as a suppository. She grimaces. But she has already been at it for an hour. The odds that seizures will kill Preston increase every year; the damage in his brain may soon be permanent. She is compelled to try.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;OK,&rdquo; Ana says as she fills the capsules. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not going to be pretty.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>This time, she walks to him without a smile. She leads him into the bathroom and pulls down his diaper. She muscles him close.</p>
		<p>Preston squeals. Once. Then again.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I know!&rdquo; Ana pleads. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>His cries fade to whimpers. His eyelids twitch with another seizure. Ana sits on the toilet, holding him on her lap as he quivers in her arms.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s OK,&rdquo; she whispers. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s OK, Boo-Boo.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Seven months and 1,600 miles after their journey began, Ana has finally given Preston his first dose of marijuana.</p>

Their journey was harder than they expected. The answers were more elusive than the happy anecdotes seemed to promise. But they kept pressing forward because they said they had no other choice. Because Colorado was the only hope they had left.</p>

Colorado voters legalized medical marijuana in 2000 with the passage of Amendment 20.">Medical marijuana</span> has made Colorado a promised land for desperate parents trying to save their children.</p>

			<p class="lead">What is CBD?</p>
			<p>CBD &mdash; or <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip tip-top radius" title="The scientific name for CBD.">cannabidiol</span>, as it&rsquo;s known scientifically &mdash; is one of dozens of compounds in marijuana called <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip tip-top radius" title="Chemical compounds that plug into specialized receptors on cells. Cannabinoids can be produced by the body (endocannabinoids). But they are also found in marijuana. THC and CBD are the two most well-known cannabinoids found in marijuana.">cannabinoids</span>. The compounds work by plugging into receptors on nerve cells, although much of their activity is still unclear. Tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, is the most famous cannabinoid found in marijuana. But, unlike THC, CBD does not get users stoned.</p>
			<p class="lead">How is CBD taken?</p>
			<p>Kids using CBD don&rsquo;t smoke it. Instead, it comes infused into a cooking oil, like olive or safflower oil. Typically, parents are told to squirt the oil under their children&rsquo;s tongues. But some families mix it in food or give it through a feeding tube.</p>
			<p class="lead">How is CBD oil made?</p>
			<p>No child in Colorado currently takes pure CBD. Instead, think of a marijuana plant like a chunk of gold ore. Only a tiny part of it is valuable; the rest needs to be refined away. To do this, CBD producers grow marijuana plants that are high in CBD and then use a solvent to dissolve the cannabinoids off the harvested plant material. The resulting slurry has the same cannabinoid makeup of the plant it came from. Depending on the method, the solvent may be evaporated away and the rest is diluted into oil.</p>
			<p class="lead">How much does it cost?</p>
			<p>Overall cost varies based on the amount a child takes, which itself varies based on how big the child is. Different providers also charge different prices. For kids using Charlotte&rsquo;s Web, a typical family spends about $300 a month for CBD oil.</p>

		<p>At least two children and one woman across the country have died while their families prepared to move to Colorado for medical marijuana. One child who made it here died when the treatment didn&rsquo;t help her condition enough. Her mother moved back home alone.</p>
		<p>But no one knows more than anecdotes because Colorado does not track how many families come to treat their children with medical marijuana &mdash; although it&rsquo;s in the low hundreds &mdash; or where they go.</p>
		<p>No agency thoroughly regulates the treatment providers, beyond basic licensing. No rules govern the right formulation or dosage of the marijuana extract at the core of the treatment. No studies conclusively document the side effects.</p>
		<p>Most important, no one knows how often it works.</p>
		<p>A handful of organizations have sprouted in the past couple of years to offer support to parents moving to Colorado and those already here. Communities of families have grown up to provide advice and encouragement and a happy source of friendship.</p>
		<p>But, when parents such as Ana Watson arrive with little more than a desperately sick child and a hope to make it better, they walk into uncharted territory. They become part of a medical experiment that plays out in living rooms, not doctors&rsquo; offices.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be the parent who didn&rsquo;t try,&rdquo; said Jan&eacute;a Cox, a mother from Georgia who brought her daughter to Colorado in March for treatment of seizures that left her unable to even breathe on her own. The move meant breaking up her family; her husband remained at home in Georgia.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Colorado represents hope at this point,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This is the state of hope.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Smaller numbers of children in California and other states have also begun to use marijuana to treat seizures.

		<p>It&rsquo;s not just that parents are taking a gamble by moving to Colorado. It&rsquo;s that they don&rsquo;t even know the odds.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;When these kids come, we hear a lot about it,&rdquo; said Dr. Larry Wolk, head of the Colorado health department and a skeptic of the treatment&rsquo;s success. &ldquo;They get their CBD oil or their Charlotte&rsquo;s Web. And if they respond, we continue to hear about it. If they don&rsquo;t, they quickly disappear.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Like all of the parents coming to Colorado in search of a cure, Ana Watson hopes hers will become a success story. Staying in North Carolina offered no hope for Preston. Still, she can&rsquo;t predict what lies ahead.</p>

		<p>Ana was only 19 when she learned she was pregnant with Preston. She was a college freshman who had to take a break from school and live with her parents for a few months in rural Whitsett, N.C., while she prepared for motherhood. Her pregnancy was normal, aside from the delicate tremors she sometimes thought she felt in her womb. Her high school sweetheart, Preston&rsquo;s father, drifted out of her life. He has never seen Preston in person.</p>
		<p>After Preston&rsquo;s birth, the doctors told Ana that his strange leg twitches were common &mdash; the result of underdeveloped muscles. It was three months later that she learned the doctors were wrong.</p>
		<p>She was giving Preston a bath &mdash; not his first, not unusual. But then his eyes rolled back in his head and his face went white and his little body began to shake and Ana was certain he was dying. At the hospital, doctors quickly sent her home. Lots of kids have random seizures that never recur, they said. But Preston&rsquo;s did.</p>
		<p>Ana doesn&rsquo;t remember what Preston&rsquo;s first word was. What she does remember is that first word arrived right on time. As did his first crawls. And his first steps.</p>
		<section class="large-6 medium-6 small-12 columns inset left">
			<h3 class="subheading">How a child becomes a medical marijuana patient</h3>
			<p>Colorado has a special process for kids to be registered as medical marijuana patients under state law. These are the steps:</p>
			<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> At least one parent and the child must be Colorado residents. Residency can be established quickly.</p>
			<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Two separate doctors must recommend that the child use marijuana. Doctors can make the recommendation only if they diagnose the child with one of eight conditions: cancer, HIV, glaucoma, cachexia, persistent muscle spasms, seizures, severe nausea or severe pain.</p>
			<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Parents must fill out an application and get it notarized. The application includes a parental consent form that both parents must sign. Parents must submit a copy of the child&rsquo;s birth certificate, and they must list themselves as their child&rsquo;s medical marijuana caregiver.</p>
			<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The Colorado Department of Pubic Health and Environment will review the application. The department typically takes about five weeks to issue a medical marijuana card. Incomplete applications are rejected, and parents have 60 days to fix the mistakes. If an application is denied, parents must wait six months before reapplying.</p>
		</section>
		<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until his second year of life that Ana began to notice the toll the seizures were taking. When other kids Preston&rsquo;s age were learning more words and stringing them into sentences, he didn&rsquo;t. When walking and grasping led to running and catching for other children, it didn&rsquo;t for Preston. It was as though his life ground to a stop, even as time ticked on.</p>
		<p>The neurologists were baffled and kept hunting for new medicines.</p>
		<p>They started with a drug called <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip tip-top radius" title="A brand name for a drug containing valproic acid. The drug is used to treat epilepsy, bipolar disorder and migraine headaches. Side effects include tremors. It was the first drug Preston used for seizures and is one of three pharmaceuticals he still takes regularly.">Depakote</span> when Preston was 3 months old. But the seizures continued &mdash; as did the new treatments: Klonopin and Felbatol and Keppra. Zonegran and <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip tip-top radius" title="The brand name for the drug topiramate. Used to treat seizures and migraine headaches. Possible side effects include problems with vision, fatigue and loss of appetite. One of three pharmaceuticals that Preston regularly takes.">Topamax</span> and Diamox and Banzel. Vitamin infusions. A special high-fat diet. An implanted electrical nerve stimulator. There were two other drugs not yet fully approved by the federal government that cost hundreds of dollars a month. There was another that has also been suggested for use in executions.</p>
		<p>The government <a title="FDA Drug Safety and Availability page" href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/">safety sheets</a> for each drug listed dozens of side effects. <a title="Drug safety sheet for Depakote" href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DrugSafety/UCM342868.pdf">Tremors</a>. <a title="Drug safety sheet for Klonopin" href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DrugSafety/UCM225680.pdf">Problems with walking or coordination</a>. <a title="Drug safety sheet for Zonegran" href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DrugSafety/UCM152828.pdf">A potentially fatal rash</a>. <a title="Drug safety sheet for Topamax" href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DrugSafety/UCM152837.pdf">Panic attacks</a>. <a title="Drug safety sheet for Banzel" href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm088564.pdf">Thoughts of suicide</a>. <a title="Drug safety sheet for Keppra" href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DrugSafety/UCM152832.pdf">Aggression</a>.</p>
		<p>To Ana, it sometimes seemed as if what epilepsy didn&rsquo;t take from her son, the drugs would. But she also knew that just one year of uncontrolled seizures meant a 1 percent chance of dying. The longer Preston&rsquo;s seizures ran riot, the likelier epilepsy would kill him.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;You know you&rsquo;re fighting for your child,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You just do whatever it takes to get what you need for your child. People slack off. You have to stay on top of them.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Being Preston&rsquo;s mother taught her not to cry because tears won&rsquo;t make her son better. For her, there is a process: Try one thing, then move on to the next. Lessons can be learned and applied.</p>

			<h3 class="subheading">Marijuana legalization by state</h3>

		<p>So Ana kept searching for a cure.</p>
		<p>Her bookshelf at home charted the journey and spoke to her struggle. First came &ldquo;What to Expect in the First Year.&rdquo; Then &ldquo;Keeping Faith.&rdquo; Then &ldquo;Delmar&rsquo;s Drug Reference for Health Care Professionals.&rdquo; Then &ldquo;Three Weeks to Say Goodbye.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Ana married, and Sydney was born. She and her husband fell into debt, in part because of medical bills before Preston qualified for Medicaid. Their marriage collapsed under the stress, and Ana moved back in with her parents. She tried working full time, then cut back to part time.</p>
		<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until Preston was 6 years old that doctors finally put a name to his condition: <a title="What is Dravet syndrome?" href="http://www.dravetfoundation.org/dravet-syndrome/what-is-dravet-syndrome">Dravet 
		syndrome</a>. And in some ways, that was worse than not knowing at all because it meant there was no cure to find.</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">&ldquo;Seizures all of the time&rdquo;</h3>

		<p class="lead">At the North Carolina Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Chapel Hill in May, Dr. Robert Greenwood hustled into the meeting room wearing a tie covered with Dr. Seuss characters.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a constant struggle of trying to limit the number of seizures he has,&rdquo; Greenwood said of Preston, who at age 1 started as a patient of Greenwood&rsquo;s. &ldquo;We have tried literally everything.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>As a pediatric neurologist, Greenwood had treated hundreds of kids with epilepsy in his 37-year career. But Preston&rsquo;s case was a unique challenge.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;In his case, the biggest problem is he has seizures every day,&rdquo; Greenwood said. &ldquo;Multiple seizures. At times, he could walk down the hall and you could see 10 to 20 seizures happening, little jerks. So he was literally having seizures all of the time.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Dravet isn&rsquo;t like other epilepsies.</p>
		<p>While some can be treated by targeting the specific areas of the brain where the seizures&rsquo; electrical overloads originate, Dravet&rsquo;s seizures come from everywhere, the result of a genetic mutation that occurs in every nerve cell in the brain.</p>
		<p>Some epilepsies respond well to generalized anti-seizure drugs. But the specific genetic mutation of each Dravet patient is different, meaning what works for some won&rsquo;t work for others. Preston has at least four different kinds of seizure types, and they varied in severity and frequency as he grew older.</p>

So, over and over, he learns the same things.</p>
		<p>At 12 years old, Preston cannot spell his name. He cannot reliably count to 10. He is still learning his colors. He doesn&rsquo;t know his mom&rsquo;s name or where he lives or how to call home if he gets lost. He wobbles when he walks and falls over easily.</p>

		<p>Sometimes, Greenwood and Ana would find a medicine that worked for Preston. The seizures would lessen and Preston would start to walk more steadily. But, just as quickly, Preston&rsquo;s brain would rewire itself back to a broken state and the seizures would return. </p>
		<p>Sitting in the hospital meeting room, Greenwood said there was little more he could do for Preston with the medicines available. Without something new, Preston&rsquo;s seizures would continue into adulthood &mdash; assuming he didn&rsquo;t die before then.</p>

		<p class="lead">Preston&rsquo;s eyes slowly opened somewhere under the fluff of his mother&rsquo;s comforter.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Time to get up, Boo-Boo,&rdquo; Ana said to him. &ldquo;Come on.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>A voice tiptoed back to her with the peanut-butter-mouth slur of a child&rsquo;s early words: &ldquo;Wuh moh minuh.&rdquo;</p>

		</div>
		<p>It was about a month before the move away from their little brick house in Greensboro, N.C., and, sometime in the night before, Preston left his own bed and sleepwalked into Ana&rsquo;s. Sydney was already there. When Ana woke before dawn, she was nestled between children.</p>
		<p>Once begun, the morning ticked along with practiced precision. Ana made the fried potatoes Preston only ever wants for breakfast. Eight-year-old Sydney quietly dressed and got ready on her own, until it was time to ask mom to fix her ponytail.</p>
		<p>Finally dragging Preston from bed, Ana sat him in his skull-and-crossbones pajamas in front of the television and turned on a video of Barney the dinosaur. Sydney walked by and scrunched up her face. She had already outgrown Barney.</p>
		<p>But Preston watched rapturously, planting his elbows onto his knees and his head into his hands. His eyes are a deep walnut color and are framed by long eyelashes. Brown hair swirls atop his head in casual rebellion. His smile is all in the top lip, pulling up past his gum line to reveal a row of glimmering teeth.</p>
		<p>Slowly working his way through the potatoes, Preston&rsquo;s hands stopped and his eyelids flickered for a few seconds before popping back open. The first seizure of the day had come and gone.</p>

		<p>Over the fireplace hung a photo of Preston in a straw cowboy hat. He&rsquo;s shirtless, leaning onto his left elbow. His mouth is closed and his eyes set in a stoic glare, and he appears startlingly mature &mdash; a boy trying to look like a man trying to look like a rock star.</p>
		<p>There are times, Ana said, when she can almost see what Preston could become if the seizures would just let him.</p>
		<p>Everyone in her family has their own vision of what Preston might be. Ana&rsquo;s mom sees Preston getting a job at a park running a lawn mower. Ana&rsquo;s dad &mdash; the man who taught Preston how to be a boy, to love mowers and tractors, and to shout, &ldquo;Crank it!&rdquo; &mdash; imagines playing catch with his grandson.</p>
		<p>Ana tries to keep her daydreams in check. What good is it to view her child as something he&rsquo;s not? But there is one thing she hears the parents of Dravet children often say, and, yes, she hesitantly admitted, she would like it, too.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;The big thing that parents are always saying,&rdquo; Ana said, &ldquo;is they want their child to say, ‘I love you.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">A leap into the unknown</h3>

		<p class="lead">Ana&rsquo;s decision to move had seemed like an easy one. In late 2012, she saw on Facebook <a title="Medical marijuana helps stem 6-year-old's seizures" href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/10/health/medical-marijuana-child/">a video</a> of a California man using medical marijuana to treat his son&rsquo;s seizures. &ldquo;This brought tears to my eyes!&rdquo; she wrote then.</p>
		<p>The documentary about Charlotte Figi <a title="Marijuana stops child's severe seizures" href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/07/health/charlotte-child-medical-marijuana/">aired 
		the next summer</a>, and by late 2013 &mdash; as Preston approached his 12th birthday stuck in the same developmental rut he had been in for his previous nine &mdash; the online whispers of a marijuana miracle in Colorado had turned into a roar. One by one, other Dravet children&rsquo;s parents &mdash; with whom Ana had become close friends online but never met in person &mdash; began arriving in Colorado, posting hopeful updates on their children&rsquo;s progress. The hope tugged at her.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve pretty much tried everything else we can,&rdquo; she reasoned.</p>
		<p>And so this was the logical next step. A leap into the unknown.</p>
		<p>The closer the move came, the worse Preston seemed to get. He suffered a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip tip-top radius" title="A seizure characterized by violent convulsing and loss of consciousness. Also known as a tonic-clonic seizure.">grand mal seizure</span> at the fundraiser Ana and her parents put together to raise the $15,000 needed for the move. He suffered another grand mal returning from a last-second beach getaway.</p>

		<p>He grew reluctant to eat or drink, which left him not only weak but also not getting the right dose of conventional medicine hidden in his food. The day the movers arrived, Preston sat on the grass holding his grandmother&rsquo;s hand while the blinkies attacked.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Wha doin&rsquo;?&rdquo; he shouted between seizures, because he didn&rsquo;t know what it meant for the movers to be there.</p>
		<p>In advance of the move, Ana reduced the dose of one of the three main seizure medicines he takes &mdash; a drug called <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip tip-top radius" title="The brand name for the drug clobazam. A type of benzodiazepine, Onfi is used to treat seizures. Side effects include sleepiness, clumsiness and slowness of thinking.

He was now taking about a third less than what Greenwood had prescribed, although she didn&rsquo;t tell the doctor her plan.
		</p>
		<p>Greenwood had been cautiously supportive of Ana&rsquo;s move, in part because it preserved some of his input into Preston&rsquo;s care. Tell a family no when they&rsquo;re on the trail of hope, and they&rsquo;ll leave you behind. For all of the parents asking him about moving to Colorado &mdash; Ana was not the first &mdash; Greenwood had told them the same thing: There&rsquo;s no hard evidence it works, but there&rsquo;s no hard evidence it&rsquo;s causing harm, either.</p>
		<p>When he looked at the exodus of families heading to Colorado, Greenwood worried about the people who might prey on their desperation. But he also worried about the enthusiasm that might spring from their hope. He had warned Ana strongly against taking Preston off his other seizure drugs.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;He is quite capable of going into a seizure that is basically all the time &mdash; all day and all night,&rdquo; Greenwood said.</p>
		<p>After the movers left, Preston&rsquo;s blinkies hit even worse. Drool dribbled off his chin and onto his T-shirt. Milly, who was watching him while Ana packed up the last things, sensed a bigger seizure building. She fanned Preston, hoping to calm the blinking.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;You think you&rsquo;d get used to seeing him like this,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But it scares me to death every time.&rdquo;</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Hope for Preston</h3>

		<p class="lead">It took 12 days after arriving in Colorado for Ana to get the marijuana oil for Preston&rsquo;s first dose. Twelve days of waiting. Twelve days of seizing. Twelve days of wondering what would happen.</p>

				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>She had to wait another three days after picking up the oil for a lab report to come back to confirm its potency. When the day of the first dose finally arrived, in mid-July, Ana bounded into the kitchen of her new home to pull a bottle of the oil from the fridge.</p>
		<p>She cracked it open and burst into giggles.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It smells like marijuana,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think it would.&rdquo;</p>
		
		<p>Holding the bottle of amber-colored oil in her hand, she scanned the report to figure out how much she should give Preston. But the report was indecipherable. How could she convert these numbers into the recommended dose?</p>
		<p>She checked her phone for online answers. Finally, eager to move on, she set the phone down.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We have a special squirt-squirt we need to do, OK? You need to be a big boy,&rdquo; she said.</p>
		<p>Walking toward him, she had no idea of the frustration ahead, and no inkling of the discomfort she would inflict on them both in her effort to bring relief. All she knew as she looked toward her seizing son was that she held in her hands the latest, best chance to move his life forward.</p>
		<p>An hour-and-a-half later, as Preston quivered on her lap in the bathroom following the first dose, she realized this journey would be tougher than she hoped.</p>
		<p>Ana returned to the kitchen and shakily exhaled.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; she breathed back in, &ldquo;was pain.&rdquo;</p>

				<p class="lead">The nation&rsquo;s leading researchers and pharmaceutical representatives working on new treatments for epilepsy gathered at a conference this June in San Francisco. They fit in a medium-sized hotel meeting room.</p>
				<p>Because of the complexity of the human brain, epilepsy drug development is a sparse field. In 2013, there were 28 anti-seizure drugs in some stage of clinical trials in the United States, <a title="Medicines in Development for Neurological Disorders" href="http://www.phrma.org/sites/default/files/pdf/MedicinesInDevelopmentNeurologicalDisorders2013.pdf">according to the pharmaceutical industry group PhRMA</a>. Compare that with 82 trials for Alzheimer&rsquo;s drugs, 226 trials for drugs <a title="Medicines in Development for Infectious Diseases" href="http://www.phrma.org/sites/default/files/pdf/MedsInDevInfectiousDiseases2013.pdf">to treat viral diseases</a> and more than 700 trials <a title="Medicines in Development for Cancer" href="http://www.phrma.org/sites/default/files/pdf/2014-cancer-report.pdf">for cancer-fighting drugs</a>.</p>
				<p>What&rsquo;s more, even epilepsy drugs that make it to market often aren&rsquo;t as effective as they were in their trials. After several months on a drug that initially works, the brain can rewire itself back to its original state, a reflection of something known as &ldquo;<a title="Homeostatic Plasticity" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostatic_plasticity">homeostatic plasticity</a>.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;When you poke the CNS (central nervous system) with one therapeutic in one system, the CNS tends to poke back,&rdquo; Christopher Gallen, the president and CEO of SK Biopharmaceuticals, said at the conference, hosted by the Epilepsy Foundation.</p>
				<p>About one-third of the nation&rsquo;s 3 million epilepsy patients don&rsquo;t have adequately controlled seizures. But the genetic variability and rarity of Dravet syndrome makes the disease especially difficult for drug companies.</p>
				<p>Dr. Jacqueline French, the director of the Clinical Trials Consortium at New York University&rsquo;s Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, estimated that as few as 5,000 patients nationwide have Dravet syndrome. It could cost hundreds of millions of dollars for a pharmaceutical company to get a drug all the way through federal approvals and onto the market to treat that little pocket of patients.</p>
				<p>And, even then, there&rsquo;s little guarantee that the drug would be effective for all Dravet patients.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s highly unlikely any one medication will help all children with Dravet,&rdquo; Stephen Collins, the president and CEO of the drug company Insero Health, said at the conference.</p>
				<p>Because of those challenges, the drugs being developed for Dravet syndrome all have a certain this-is-just-crazy-enough-to-work quality.</p>
				<p>At the conference, drug rep after drug rep stepped to the microphone to discuss the forthcoming products. The presentations for Dravet treatments included a traditional Chinese herbal remedy; an allergy drug; a plan to create tiny fish with replicas of individual patients&rsquo; genetic mutations for more personalized medicines; and Fenfluramine, best known as the &ldquo;Fen&rdquo; in <a title="Fen-Phen Safety Update Information" href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm072820.htm">the notorious weight-loss drug Fen-Phen</a>.</p>
				<p>Within this context, treating Dravet syndrome with pot didn&rsquo;t seem so absurd. And, not coincidentally, two drug companies at the conference presented plans to bring CBD-based drugs to market. A spot was also reserved for Paige Figi, the mother of Charlotte Figi, the little girl whose story started the Colorado CBD rush.</p>
				<p>Surrounded by physicians and Ph.D.&rsquo;s, Figi spoke cautiously. She talked about wanting to start clinical trials on Colorado-made CBD products. She tried to tamp down hype.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I think patients come and expect to find 100 percent seizure control,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But some don&rsquo;t have success at all. This is just a new seizure treatment.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>So, the entire day after that first dose, Ana watched Preston like a poker player looking for a tell.</p>
		<p>Preston yawned. Did that mean the marijuana made him sleepy? Preston ate. Did the extract make him hungry? Preston didn&rsquo;t seem to seize as often.</p>
		<p>Was it working?</p>
		<p>Then the next day, Preston suffered a grand mal seizure that left him writhing violently. He had another one the day after that. Getting him to eat or drink had become nearly impossible, and that meant he wasn&rsquo;t getting consistent doses of either the CBD treatment or his traditional medications, both of which Ana tried to hide in Preston&rsquo;s food or sweet tea.</p>
		<p>So now Ana is sitting in the hospital whose doctors have been the most outspoken in Colorado in urging parents not to use marijuana to control seizures &mdash; it&rsquo;s too risky, they say; there are too many unknowns &mdash; and she is hoping for advice on what to do.</p>

		</div>
		<p>&ldquo;Basically, we&rsquo;ve tried it all,&rdquo; Ana says. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we moved here for CBD. His doctors said we can&rsquo;t go up in his meds anymore, and we were at a stopping point.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Ana sighs, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve tried everything.&rdquo;</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t make recommendations&rdquo;</h3>

		<p class="lead">The CBD rush to Colorado is a movement that divides patients from doctors.</p>
		<p>Even as families flock to the state, few doctors here condone the use of marijuana to treat seizures. And that means the very people on whom families depend for medical advice are often silent when it comes to critical questions about the new treatment.</p>
		<p>The state health department, which manages the patient registry that all children using medical marijuana must join, offers almost no guidance.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;What I always tell people is you have to be really careful,&rdquo; said Dr. Larry Wolk, the executive director of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. &ldquo;They have to know that it&rsquo;s outside of the regulatory process, outside of the (Food and Drug Administration), and it&rsquo;s very much &lsquo;Buyer beware.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Many of the families arriving in the state for medical marijuana &mdash; as well as those already living here &mdash; seek out the care of specialists at Children&rsquo;s Hospital Colorado. About 100 kids who see doctors at the hospital have tried a CBD treatment.</p>
		<p>But no doctor at Children&rsquo;s recommends using cannabis or gives more than cautious advice about it.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t make recommendations about the marijuana therapy because we don&rsquo;t have the information to do that,&rdquo; said Dr. Amy Brooks-Kayal, the head of pediatric neurology at Children&rsquo;s. &ldquo;We feel very strongly that we need to act on good medical and scientific evidence, and that doesn&rsquo;t exist.&rdquo;</p>
		<p><a title="CBD and marijuana: Q-PULSE Survey" href="http://www.aesnet.org/sites/default/files/file_attach/ProfessionalEducation/Currents/2014/epcu-14-5-291%20Its%20Current%20Carlson.pdf">A national survey</a> of doctors by the American Epilepsy Society found that while 94 percent said they have been asked by a patient about using cannabis to control seizures, fewer than a third would actually recommend that patients try it.

				<h3 class="subheading">Every patient&rsquo;s Dravet syndrome is a little different</h3>

				<p class="lead">In a lab in Seattle, black mice twitch uncontrollably as they work their way through an electrified cage, furry little avatars of kids with Dravet syndrome.</p>
				<p>No matter how many times they run the experiment, they never seem to learn to avoid the shock.</p>
				<p>The mice were created in the lab of William Catterall, a University of Washington pharmacologist whose work on the brain has seen him mentioned <a title="Pharmacology chair Bill Catterall lauded with 2010 Canadian medical award" href="http://www.washington.edu/news/2010/04/08/pharmacology-chair-bill-catterall-lauded-with-2010-canadian-medical-award/">as a Nobel Prize candidate</a>. These genetically engineered mice are providing answers to stubborn questions about the causes of Dravet syndrome. But they are also providing confirmation of how hard the cure will be to find.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Every circuit in the brain that you use to process information is imbalanced,&rdquo; Catterall said.</p>
				<p>For years after French doctor Charlotte Dravet described her namesake disease, researchers were at a loss to explain what caused it. Halfway around the world, Catterall and his colleagues were coming up with an answer. Using scorpion venom in experiments, Catterall helped reveal the workings of the brain&rsquo;s electrical grid and especially something called the sodium ion channel.</p>
				<p>A brain nerve cell, or neuron, is like a spark plug, shooting a signal out to other cells to start a task. To do that, electrically charged ions flow into the neuron&rsquo;s sodium and other channels until they build up enough to fire a spark &mdash; one millionth of one millionth of the current in a home electrical socket.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;They make a tiny little electrical signal,&rdquo; Catterall said. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s what all brain function is based on.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Genetic mutations in the sodium ion channel can create funky electrical activity in the brain, something Catterall knew could apply to epilepsy research. In 2001, the year Preston was born, a team of researchers in Belgium proved him right. They <a title="De novo mutations in the sodium-channel gene SCN1A cause severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11359211">identified a specific sodium channel gene</a>, known as <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip tip-top radius" title="A sodium ion channel gene. Roughly 70 percent of all patients with Dravet syndrome are found to have a mutation in the SCN1A gene.">SCN1A</span>, in which almost all Dravet patients have a mutation.</p>
				<p>Catterall believes the defect impacts only what are called &ldquo;inhibitory neurons,&rdquo; while leaving &ldquo;excitatory neurons&rdquo; alone. Typically, the two work in conjunction. Excitatory neurons promote a function. Inhibitory neurons stop it.</p>
				<p>But when the inhibitory neurons don&rsquo;t work, the result is electrical gridlock. Catterall likens it to having green lights in every direction for downtown traffic. Basically, the brains of Dravet patients are all gas and no brakes.</p>
				<p>The discovery helped doctors eliminate some types of medicines they had been prescribing to Dravet patients and unintentionally making seizures worse. But it still left a challenge.</p>
				<p>The SCN1A mutation is almost never inherited. Instead, it occurs &ldquo;de novo,&rdquo; meaning it forms uniquely in each and every Dravet patient when they are conceived. Catterall said more than 600 different types of SCN1A mutations have been found, and the gene&rsquo;s coding has 6,000 different links where something could go wrong.</p>
				<p>What that means is every patient&rsquo;s Dravet syndrome is a little different. Some respond well to certain drugs. Some don&rsquo;t. Some have seizures so severe that they can&rsquo;t walk or talk. Meanwhile, <a title="Dannielle's Story" href="http://dravetdata.com/danielle.htm">a Dravet patient in Australia</a> named Dannielle Goodwin has held a job, lived on her own and is now raising three children.</p>
				<p>She is perhaps the only Dravet patient alive who can describe what it&rsquo;s like to have a seizure.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I feel like I&rsquo;m being hung upside down and tipped back and all the blood comes rushing back into my head, with a feeling of dread,&rdquo; she <a title="Melbourne University Magazine" href="http://www.unimelb.edu.au/alumni/mum/2011/mum-2011-web.pdf">told a magazine at the University of Melbourne</a>, where her neurologist works. &ldquo;I get a really dry mouth, like after you&rsquo;ve had your teeth cleaned at the dentist.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Catterall&rsquo;s lab developed one of the first lines of Dravet mice <a title="Reduced sodium current in GABAergic interneurons in a mouse model of severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16921370">in the mid-2000s</a> and since then has published more than a dozens studies using the mice. Catterall said more research is planned, and he has a proposal to study how CBD might work on his mice. But Catterall said Dravet syndrome&rsquo;s rarity means research on the disease moves forward in inches.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t a large number of people who are working on Dravet syndrome at all,&rdquo; he said.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;For the doctor to know what they need to know about an illegal drug is a very high expectation,&rdquo; said Dr. Jacqueline French, an epilepsy specialist at New York University&rsquo;s Langone Medical Center. She said CBD is &ldquo;driving the conversation&rdquo; many doctors now have with their patients.</p>
		<p>The result of that one-sided conversation, though, is that parents who give CBD to their children must turn to one another and their medical marijuana providers for help. Facebook has become a crowd-sourced doctor&rsquo;s office. Colorado&rsquo;s sometimes ragtag community of medical marijuana growers acts as a de facto human services agency.</p>
		<p>By not engaging more with providers, doctors often lack an understanding of the types of marijuana products their patients are using and are unaware of the sometimes contradictory advice their patients receive.</p>
		<p>For instance, CBD providers commonly tell newly arrived parents that they should reduce the level of an anti-seizure drug called Onfi before starting CBD because the two could have a dangerous interaction. Parents often reduce the medicine without consulting with their doctors. Doctors at Children&rsquo;s, though, say they haven&rsquo;t seen conclusive evidence that CBD has an impact on Onfi levels. Meager research makes it impossible to know who is right.</p>
		<p>Some physicians are now stepping forward to work with providers <a title="Finally, Some Hard Science on Medical Marijuana for Epilepsy Patients" href="http://time.com/3264691/medical-marijauna-epilepsy-research-charlottes-web-study/">on clinical trials for CBD</a>, and doctors at Children&rsquo;s have begun recording more specific details of the CBD products their patients are using &mdash; who is providing the medical marijuana and how much the child is taking, for instance. But the broader dynamic still hinders the study of CBD&rsquo;s effectiveness. And that only increases the uncertainty that hangs over families such as Ana&rsquo;s in their Colorado exile.</p>
		<p>Leaving Children&rsquo;s after the first visit, Ana still has questions about CBD. But doctors there have set up several new appointments to address other aspects of Preston&rsquo;s care. He will soon have a feeding tube inserted into his stomach, allowing Ana to give him food and medicine consistently. She&rsquo;ll take him to get fitted for a new helmet to protect him in falls.</p>
		<p>A plan is taking shape.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I thought it went really well,&rdquo; she says.</p>

				<h3 class="subheading">Big pharmaceutical companies consider medical marijuana</h3>

				<p class="lead">To doctors concerned about recommending unregulated cannabis products to their patients, the future of medical marijuana is growing in the south of England.</p>
				<p>There, researchers with the drugmaker GW Pharmaceuticals are developing medicines derived from greenhouse-grown cannabis plants &mdash; tinctures and mouth sprays to treat everything from muscle spasticity to cancer pain to epilepsy. But scientific breakthroughs are not what led GW to develop the drugs. Rather, it was public opinion.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;We got into this business because patients who have spasticity due to multiple sclerosis went to the government&rdquo; and asked for medical marijuana, said Steve Schultz, GW&rsquo;s U.S.-based vice president for investor relations.</p>
				<p>Last year, when interest in using CBD to treat epilepsy first skyrocketed, GW responded by developing a CBD drug. The drug, <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip tip-top radius" title="A CBD drug in development by British drug company GW Pharmaceuticals. Epidiolex is derived from greenhouse-grown cannabis plants and then processed to be 98 percent pure CBD.">Epidiolex</span>, is now in early clinical trials in the United States.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been tremendous demand from pediatric epileptologists,&rdquo; Schultz said.</p>
				<p>The pattern reveals how hope can leap ahead of research even at the highest levels of drug development. Epidiolex is one of two CBD drugs being developed by pharmaceutical companies to treat pediatric epilepsies, and neither drugmaker has hidden that public interest is behind the creation of the drugs.</p>
				<p>Last summer, at a conference discussing forthcoming epilepsy drugs, Mark Davis with Insys Therapeutics &mdash; which is developing <a title="Insys Receives DEA Approval to Produce Pharmaceutical Cannabidiol" href="http://insysrx.mwnewsroom.com/press-releases/insys-receives-dea-approval-to-produce-pharmaceutical-cannabidiol-updates-status-nasdaq-insy-1151788">a synthetic form of CBD</a> &mdash; said his Arizona company still had much to learn about what exactly CBD does. Nonetheless, Insys has received special government approval for its CBD product to treat conditions ranging from epilepsy to brain tumors to pediatric schizophrenia.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of noise going on about the use of medical marijuana in a number of different indications,&rdquo; Davis said at the conference. &ldquo;And we believe we have developed a good alternative.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Supporters of pharmaceutical pot say it is consistent, quality-controlled and tested in ways that cannabis grown by medical marijuana providers is not.</p>
				<p>Epidiolex is derived from CBD-rich cannabis plants that are then refined in a process that&rsquo;s a higher-tech version of the process that creates Charlotte&rsquo;s Web and other Colorado CBD products. Schultz said Epidiolex is 98 percent pure CBD, diluted into sesame oil and given a &ldquo;raspberry-lime&rdquo; flavor. However, Schultz said GW does not claim to grow its plants organically, something most Colorado medical marijuana growers <a title="Frequently Asked Questions" href="http://theroc.us/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=32&amp;Itemid=199">pride themselves on</a>.</p>
				<p>GW is setting up a placebo-controlled clinical trial that will include about 80 patients; an early clinical trial looking at the drug&rsquo;s safety enrolled about 30 kids. Roughly 300 more kids at 12 different hospitals in the United States have received Epidiolex through a special program that allows doctors to prescribe experimental drugs to treat rare diseases, Schultz said.</p>
				<p>But the results from that program show Epidiolex may be effective for only a fraction of patients. <a title="Efficacy and Safety of Epidiolex (Cannabidiol) in Children and Young Adults With Treatment-Resistant Epilepsy" href="https://www.aesnet.org/meetings_events/annual_meeting_abstracts/view/1868751">A study</a> of patients using Epidiolex in New York and California found that about a third of the patients studied had a greater than 50 percent reduction in seizures.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;These results are encouraging, especially since they involved a group of children and young adults with very treatment-resistant epilepsy,&rdquo; Dr. Orrin Devinsky, the New York University epilepsy specialist who was the study&rsquo;s lead author, said <a title="Three Studies Shed New Light on the Effectiveness of Cannabis in Epilepsy" href="https://www.aesnet.org/sites/default/files/file_attach/AboutAES/PressReleases/cannabis%20release%20vfinal.pdf">in a statement</a>. &ldquo;However, we await the planned double-blind study to truly assess the safety and efficacy of Epidiolex.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>At the end of their first visit, Dr. Kelly Knupp, Preston&rsquo;s new neurologist at Children&rsquo;s, suggested the EEG so that the hospital could have some starting record of Preston&rsquo;s brain activity. The timing worked; Preston was already in the hospital, after the feeding tube surgery the day before.</p>
		<p>But, to get a true starting level, the EEG meant Ana would need to take Preston off CBD temporarily. She had spent seven months planning how to get to Colorado for the treatment. She was pausing it after five days.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;The point of this is to get a baseline,&rdquo; Knupp had told Ana, &ldquo;so that after you&rsquo;re on CBD, you can have a baseline to look at.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>While doctors at Children&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t exactly want their patients on CBD, they are eager to find out what it&rsquo;s doing. Knupp told Ana that doctors at the hospital now recommend all patients have both an EEG and a bloodwork exam prior to starting CBD. They would like to run follow-up tests every three or four months.</p>
		<p>The results from the first batch of CBD kids tested made their way <a title="Parental Reporting of Response To Oral Cannabis Extracts As Adjunctive Treatment For Medically Refractory Epilepsy" href="http://www.aesnet.org/meetings_events/annual_meeting_abstracts/view/1868031">into a study</a> that Knupp and two other doctors will present this week at the <a title="American Epilepsy Society annual meeting abstract search" href="http://www.aesnet.org/meetings_events/annual_meeting_abstracts">American Epilepsy Society conference</a> in Seattle. Of the 58 children tested, 31 percent saw their seizures reduce by half, the study found. About 50 percent of the patients saw at least some seizure reduction.</p>
		<p>But the results were ultimately even less conclusive.</p>

		<p>Doctors at Children&rsquo;s Hospital Colorado recommend that kids with epilepsy get a baseline EEG before beginning CBD treatments. Doctors then ask patients to follow up with another EEG three or four months later to gauge if any changes have occurred. EEGs aren&rsquo;t sensitive enough to pick up on all improvements &mdash; such as if a child begins using new words. But doctors believe it is a good way to measure big changes. &ldquo;If your EEG is abnormal, it&rsquo;s probably going to be pretty hard to be a good student,&rdquo; said Dr. Kevin Chapman, a neurologist at Children&rsquo;s.</p>

		<p>The doctors relied on parents to report how much CBD reduced seizures. And that opened the door for the study&rsquo;s two most intriguing findings.</p>
		<p>The hospital didn&rsquo;t see any improvement in the before-and-after EEGs of four kids whose seizures appeared to lessen significantly. That may have been due to something called &ldquo;electroclinical dissociation,&rdquo; where the seizure still occurs but its outward indicators disappear. It also might be that parents can pick up on smaller improvements than an EEG can, said Dr. Kevin Chapman, a pediatric neurologist at Children&rsquo;s who was a co-author on the study.</p>
		<p>But the study also calls into question parents&rsquo; ability to be objective. The doctors found that parents who had moved to Colorado for medical marijuana were much more likely to report that it had helped their children significantly than those who were already living in Colorado &mdash; 52 percent compared with 17 percent. In other words, the greater the leap of hope it took to try CBD, the more likely a parent was to see progress.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We worry about all the stresses that families had to go through to start the treatment,&rdquo; Chapman said. &ldquo;That desire for it to be effective may cloud their recognition of seizures.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Supporters of the CBD treatment say Children&rsquo;s sample was skewed because the hospital might not be seeing the kids doing best on medical marijuana. State health officials <a title="Colorado health officials recommend grants to 8 marijuana studies" href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_27005133/colorado-health-officials-recommend-grants-8-marijuana-studies">have recommended</a> that Children&rsquo;s receive <a title="Medical marijuana research grant recommendations" href="http://www.colorado.gov/cdphe/MMR-research-grant-recommendations">nearly $1 million in grants</a> for further research.</p>
		<p>Even if the treatment is successful, though, no one knows what will happen if kids who have seized their whole lives suddenly stop. Do they develop normally? Or does their underlying condition continue to inhibit their growth?</p>
		<p>Including the new Children&rsquo;s study, the nine studies or surveys looking at whether CBD controls seizures in humans form a scientific crazy quilt.</p>

				<h3 class="subheading">Researchers bemoan roadblocks to medical marijuana research</h3>

				<p class="lead">Four decades ago, a scientist in Utah envisioned a time when a medicine made from marijuana might be available at the pharmacy.</p>
				<p>Researcher Ralph Karler at the University of Utah&rsquo;s College of Medicine injected mice with one of three compounds found in cannabis &mdash; psychoactive THC, the closely related CBN or the non-stoning CBD. Then he shocked the mice to cause a seizure.</p>
				<p>While THC had a small benefit in stopping the seizure and CBN had a little more, CBD &mdash; known more scientifically as cannabidiol &mdash; was the clear winner. The result was illuminating: Just because CBD didn&rsquo;t get you high didn&rsquo;t mean it wasn&rsquo;t working.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;The main point,&rdquo; Karler wrote in a slim, five-page paper published in 1973, &ldquo;is that CBD and CBN, substances generally thought to be pharmacologically inactive, possess significant anticonvulsant activity relative to delta-9-THC.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Karler&rsquo;s finding didn&rsquo;t stand alone for long. In the mid-to-late 1970s, there was a burst of research worldwide that suggested CBD could be effective at controlling seizures in lab tests.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;CBD &hellip; was active in reducing or blocking convulsions,&rdquo; one study concluded.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;CBD was an effective and relatively potent anticonvulsant,&rdquo; another found.</p>
				<p>A small trial in Brazil confirmed CBD&rsquo;s potential to treat seizures in humans. But, after a few straggler studies on CBD and epilepsy were published in the early 1980s, research stopped almost completely. The scientists who worked on the early studies knew why.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;It was just (that) people, in general, thought that this was dirty stuff to work with,&rdquo; Karler, now retired, said by telephone from his home near Salt Lake City. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t one reason why cannabidiol shouldn&rsquo;t have been pursued as an anti-convulsant.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>By the early 1980s &mdash; the era of Just Say No &mdash; the politics of marijuana had turned too toxic to sustain the science of it, and many researchers gave up working with pot.</p>
				<p>Only in the past two years &mdash; as attitudes toward marijuana have softened &mdash; has research on marijuana and epilepsy picked up. Since 2012, there have been 27 studies published worldwide on cannabidiol and epilepsy, according to a search of the federal government&rsquo;s medical literature database, PubMed. That compares with 21 published between 1973 and 1983, and a mere six published in the two decades after.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt,&rdquo; Rob MacCoun, a law professor at Stanford University who specializes in drug policy, wrote in an e-mail, &ldquo;that politics has greatly hindered serious medical research on cannabis.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>They look at different forms of epilepsy, different kinds of seizures and different measurements of success. At least five different types of CBD-rich marijuana therapies are represented in the studies.</p>
		<p>The results swing wildly. The studies show anywhere from 30 to 80 percent of children seeing a significant seizure reduction while on CBD. And now even some doctors involved in the research question the findings.</p>
		<p>Dr. Edward Maa, an epilepsy specialist at Denver Health Medical Center, worked with the most famous CBD provider in Colorado, the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip tip-top radius" title="A non-profit organization that provides assistance to families using the Charlotte&rsquo;s Web CBD product.

The study found that nine out of the 11 families surveyed saw at least a 75 percent reduction in seizures. It was an overwhelming success rate.</p>
		<p>But now Maa wonders whether families who tried CBD with little success quit using the treatment before they could be included in the study. The Realm of Caring says only one patient had stopped using CBD at the time the survey was conducted. Maa is working on <a title="Genetic Analysis Between Charlotte's Web Responders Versus Non- Responders in a Dravet Population" href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02229032">a genetic study</a> trying to determine why some kids respond to CBD and some don&rsquo;t.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;The vast majority of people, if they were going to respond, had a dramatic reduction of seizures,&rdquo; Maa said. &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t represent the larger, global number of people who had exposure to it. We don&rsquo;t know those true numbers yet.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>In the five weeks since Preston left the hospital, Ana has restarted him on CBD &mdash; now shooting it efficiently into his feeding tube. Preston went the first two weeks without suffering a grand mal, but his blinky seizures remained.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;But they don&rsquo;t seem to me to be as long,&rdquo; Ana said.</p>
		<p>The CBD oil she was using then was a roughly 35:1 mixture of CBD to THC. But Ana, concerned that she wasn&rsquo;t using the best formulation, sought out the opinion of a Denver doctor who specializes in making medical marijuana recommendations. The doctor, Alan Shackelford, suggested Ana try a mix with more THC.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;In a way,&rdquo; he told Ana, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s an uncontrolled experiment. Which I don&rsquo;t necessarily like. But we are pressed into this circumstance.&rdquo;</p>

				<p class="lead">Charlotte Dravet&rsquo;s message to parents is simple: Don&rsquo;t move.</p>
				<p>As the namesake for the severe form of epilepsy that afflicts many children arriving in Colorado for medical marijuana treatment, Dravet said parents often ask her about whether moving to Colorado is worth it. She tells them to wait.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;It seems too early to change all the life of a family at this stage of the knowledge on this compound,&rdquo; she wrote in an e-mail to The Denver Post.</p>
				<p>Studying neurology in the south of France in the 1960s, Dravet worked under a professor named Henri Gastaut. Their research led him and another doctor to define a different type of rare epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, that many families have moved to Colorado to treat.</p>
				<p>But Dravet kept encountering kids who didn&rsquo;t fit the Lennox-Gastaut profile. Although their seizures also began early in life and came in varying forms, their brains&rsquo; electrical readings looked different. And their first seizures came about through different triggers, such as fever.</p>
				<p>In a paper published in 1978, Dravet called this new form &ldquo;severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy.&rdquo; The world would come to call it Dravet syndrome.</p>
				<p>And it was a monster.</p>
				<p>The children in Dravet&rsquo;s clinic seized constantly with little muscle jerks. Their mental development often hit a wall before their preschool years, but their bodies collapsed into old age. They bent forward and stuck their buttocks out as they walked. Their feet turned out and their ankles crooked inward. It was as though her clinic in Marseille were filled with Benjamin Buttons, the boy from literature who ages in reverse.</p>
				<p>Dravet understands the desperation that parents feel when looking for treatment for their children.</p>
				<p>For that reason, she said she hopes CBD &mdash; made in pharmaceutical form &mdash; will prove to be effective in treating Dravet syndrome. But she said there should be more research and a clinical trial first.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;All the rest is uncertain and perhaps dangerous,&rdquo; she wrote.</p>

		<p>The toy was a Slip &lsquo;N Slide, on which he and his sister, Sydney, were supposed to be shooting across the tarp and under an inflatable shark&rsquo;s mouth that held a spraying hose. Instead, Preston grabbed the hose and became the shark.</p>

		<p>Preston&rsquo;s legs folded under him, and he crashed hard to the ground. Milly burst from her chair and ran over to him, reaching him in time to see his eyes roll toward his brows. And then, lying there in the grass he had soaked, Preston began to shake violently.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s OK,&rdquo; Milly whispered into his ear, trying to talk him out of the seizure. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s OK.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Milly gathered Preston up and sat him on her lap in a chair. He breathed heavily, wheezing in and huffing out. His eyes were shut.</p>

		<p class="lead">Preston loves country songs &mdash; the louder, the better.</p>
		<p>So, one morning in mid-October, Ana Watson cues up Jason Aldean&rsquo;s &ldquo;Big Green Tractor&rdquo; on her phone and hands it to her 12-year-old son, still in his pajamas. And then something magical happens.</p>
		<p>Preston starts singing.</p>
		<p>Not so much in words that anyone else would recognize. But, as the notes leak from the purple headphones covering his ears, Preston wah-wahs with the beat.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;BAM!&rdquo; Ana writes on Facebook. &ldquo;Cannabis oil doing amazing things for my child, Preston singing big green tractor and no seizures this am!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Is this finally it?</p>
		<p>Four months after they arrived in Colorado &mdash; one of hundreds of desperate families moving here for medical marijuana for their children &mdash; the seizures that restrain Preston at the developmental level of a 2-year-old have calmed. A tumultuous beginning has given way to a month-long stretch without a grand mal seizure.</p>

				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>In that time, Preston started feeding himself, using a fork without help. He pushed himself around on his sister&rsquo;s two-wheel scooter without falling. He remembered to say &ldquo;Please&rdquo; and &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>It was subtle. But Ana swore there was a change in her son. He was more talkative, more stable on his feet.</p>
		<p>Her new friends in Colorado &mdash; parents who, like her, came to the state seeking hope through cannabis &mdash; cheered on her social media updates.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;AWESOME!!&rdquo; one wrote beneath the video of Preston singing.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Beautiful,&rdquo; another wrote. &ldquo;So beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>How, exactly, that stretch free of grand mal seizures had come about was a bit unclear. In doses four or five times a day, Ana would sometimes mix together 20 times as many drops of CBD oil as THC oil, or maybe 10 times as many drops of CBD as THC, or maybe close to equal drops of both. She had a rough idea of the dosing, but the plan was to be evasive. She believed the technique kept Preston from building up a tolerance to a specific dose.</p>
		<p>She also began giving him his traditional seizure medicines spread out over three doses a day instead of two, and Preston was also receiving intensive therapies for speech and life skills. Somewhere in that mix, a harmony emerged.</p>
		<p>So optimistic is Ana that, as Preston&rsquo;s 13th birthday approaches, she makes a bold decision: It&rsquo;s time for her son to get his first real bicycle.</p>
		<p>Her hopes for a new life seem to be coming true.</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Another setback</h3>

		<p class="lead">One week after singing &ldquo;Big Green Tractor,&rdquo; Preston suffers a short grand mal.</p>
		<p>Then, in the backyard sunshine the Sunday before Halloween, Preston&rsquo;s eyelids flick up and down from seizures. A drop of drool forms on his lips.</p>
		<p>His grandmother, Milly, brings him inside with worry.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s really blinky,&rdquo; she tells Ana.</p>
		<p>Preston&rsquo;s eyelid flutters pick up speed, jackhammering one after another, and soon Ana is struggling to lift him onto the couch. His legs dangle limply beneath him.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Jesus Christ,&rdquo; she says, straining. &ldquo;Stand up, Preston.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Moving quickly to the kitchen counter, Ana opens a medicine bag that has dinosaurs and her son&rsquo;s name on it. Her hand passes over two bottles of amber-colored marijuana oil and instead reaches for one of the six different pharmaceutical drugs also crowding the bag &mdash; a nasal spray called <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip tip-top radius" title="The brand name for the drug midazolam.

		<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not going to like this,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;He knows it burns.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Preston&rsquo;s arms flail as Ana tries to steady his head.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;This is going to make you better,&rdquo; she pleads with him. &ldquo;So you can play with your friends at the birthday party.&rdquo;</p>

				<p class="lead">The most famous plant in the Colorado CBD boom isn&rsquo;t really a plant.</p>
				<p>In <a title="Finally, Some Hard Science on Medical Marijuana for Epilepsy Patients" href="http://time.com/3264691/medical-marijauna-epilepsy-research-charlottes-web-study/">news stories</a>, in <a title="Bipartisan Legislation Would Help People Suffering from Epilepsy and Other Seizure Disorders" href="http://perry.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=391698">news releases</a> by the congressman carrying a bill to legalize it and even <a title="Frequently Asked Questions" href="http://theroc.us/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=32&amp;Itemid=199">on the website</a> of the group that provides it, Charlotte&rsquo;s Web has been described as a strain of marijuana. In early November, its growers announced that it&rsquo;s not.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Charlotte&rsquo;s Web itself is not actually a plant,&rdquo; Joel Stanley said during <a title="CW Hemp Oil Update" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3ccjge7_0">a webcast question-and-answer session</a>. &ldquo;But there are specific plant phenotypes, specific genetics that go into the Charlotte&rsquo;s Web product.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>In an interview, Stanley said Charlotte&rsquo;s Web is the brand name of the oil that he and his brothers make from their marijuana plants. He said two different strains &mdash; which he named as CW1a and CW2a &mdash; go into making Charlotte&rsquo;s Web. Last summer, under grow lights at one of the brothers&rsquo; cultivation facilities, tiny marijuana plants grew in 3-inch pots often labeled &ldquo;Charlotte&rsquo;s.&rdquo; But a sheet listing 14 different strains with names beginning with &ldquo;CW&rdquo; also hung on a shelf.</p>

				<p>Stanley said he and his brothers now engineer the Charlotte&rsquo;s Web oil to try to ensure a consistent 30:1 ratio of CBD to THC in every dose. They are now propagating plants through tissue culture &mdash; essentially starting out new plants in petri dishes. But he insisted the product is basically the same as what was given to their first patient.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Buhfday,&rdquo; he says between seizures.</p>
		<p>Today is Preston&rsquo;s birthday party.</p>
		<p>All around him, the house is decorated for a celebration. His little sister, Sydney, had been blowing up balloons and drawing jack-o-lantern faces on them with a marker. Ana had been placing candy eyeballs onto frosted cupcakes.</p>
		<p>Fairy princesses and pirates and a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle are coming to his home bearing gifts. Like him, many of the kids in those costumes suffer from rare forms of epilepsy. They are the first friends Preston has ever had.</p>
		<p>And now, the guests are only a half hour from arriving &mdash; and the rescue medicine isn&rsquo;t yet taking hold. Sydney watches her brother with concern. Ana, returning to the cupcakes, does too.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Hey, Mr. Blinky,&rdquo; she calls over to him. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t seize on me!&rdquo;</p>
		
		<h3 class="subheading">Preston&rsquo;s bike</h3>
		
		<p>The rescue medicine works just in time to stave off another grand mal.</p>
		<p>When Ana rolls out the electric blue bike with large training wheels as the big finale to Preston&rsquo;s birthday party, it feels somewhat like an artifact of her optimism. But she is undaunted.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Preston&rsquo;s bike,&rdquo; Ana tells him, and a smile grows across his face.</p>
		<p>On the street, Preston&rsquo;s grin stretches so wide it looks as though it might push his ears off his head. Sitting on the seat, he shuffles his feet along the ground to inch the bike forward. Sydney and the other kids from the neighborhood whiz by on their bikes, screaming in delight. Preston laughs in heaves. Up and down the one-block street he goes. Step by step. Scooting. Flying.</p>
		<p>Ana tries to teach Preston how to ride the bike properly.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Put your feet on the pedals,&rdquo; she tells him.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he insists.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;On the pedals,&rdquo; Ana says. &ldquo;See, you can push yourself.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Preston keeps walking the bike forward.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Let me show you,&rdquo; Ana says. &ldquo;This is how you ride a bike.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>More steps.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I give up,&rdquo; she laughs. Her son can ride his bike his way.</p>

		<p>The hundreds of families moving to Colorado to treat their children with medical marijuana arrive with no guarantees for a treatment that is not scientifically proven to work. But what they have is one another.</p>
		<p>Bound by the semi-legality of the treatment they&rsquo;ve chosen &mdash; legal under Colorado law but illegal under federal law &mdash; and the hope they&rsquo;ve attached to it, Colorado&rsquo;s medical marijuana refugees have built new communities for themselves in their adopted state. They babysit for one another and go out to dinner together and protect one another&rsquo;s kids from the cold stares of strangers. They talk one another through days filled with seizures and hug when the seizures subside. Some even live together, to split the cost of housing.</p>

		<p>One day, after Ana and Preston went to a brunch with families whose kids also suffer from Dravet syndrome &mdash; the rare form of epilepsy that afflicts Preston &mdash; another mom posted a photo on Facebook. It was of Preston and her daughter leaning into each other and grinning.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;This was their version of a hug,&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;Thank you for all the support. This moment in time has been forever captured. Let this be a testament to how wonderful our children are.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Back home in North Carolina, Ana had been like many parents of children with rare diseases: She lived on a metaphoric desert island. It was years before she met another parent whose child shared the same disease. And, even then, there were no support groups, no play dates, no joint outings to the zoo.</p>
		<p>Instead, there was Facebook, where she bonded with Dravet moms in ways that seemed impossible for her to do with the people she met in her everyday life. In Colorado, those moms now come to her house for dinner.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We just kind of feel like we get each other,&rdquo; Ana said. &ldquo;We connect on a level that other moms don&rsquo;t get.&rdquo;</p>

		</div>
		<p>This new community in Colorado has generally split into two groups, centered on the state&rsquo;s two largest providers of marijuana extracts rich in a compound called CBD that the kids take.</p>
		<p>The most famous is the Realm of Caring. Its best-known patient &mdash; a little girl named Charlotte Figi, who is the namesake of the group&rsquo;s CBD product, Charlotte&rsquo;s Web &mdash; has been featured in two documentaries and dozens of news stories. Today, the Realm of Caring serves more than 350 patients in Colorado, with an affiliate group in California serving about 150.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been an amazing support community,&rdquo; said Charlotte&rsquo;s mother, Paige. &ldquo;These were parents who didn&rsquo;t leave the house.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Because the Realm of Caring is based in Colorado Springs, parents who move to the state &mdash; often inspired by news stories about Realm patients &mdash; frequently locate there. That is what Ana did when she arrived in Colorado in late June.</p>
		<p>But, by this summer, the Realm&rsquo;s waiting list topped 10,000 names, forcing some families to seek other options. Many, including Ana, turned to Jason Cranford, a Boulder County man who owns several medical marijuana businesses but chooses to serve young patients out of his home.</p>
		<p>Cranford&rsquo;s group is the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip tip-top radius" title="A non-profit organization founded by medical marijuana provider Jason Cranford.

				<p class="lead">The CBD boom in Colorado started with a story.</p>
				<p>There were 35 juvenile medical marijuana patients in Colorado in March 2013, when CNN landed in the state to film a documentary about one of them.</p>
				<p>Since infancy, Charlotte Figi suffered from debilitating seizures due to Dravet syndrome. She practically lived at the hospital, where her parents, Paige and Matt, had signed do-not-resuscitate orders for their little girl. Every night when they went to sleep, Charlotte&rsquo;s older brother and twin sister said their goodbyes to her, not knowing whether she&rsquo;d be alive in the morning.</p>
				<p>Then, in February 2012, when Charlotte was 5 years old, her parents gave her CBD, and everything changed literally overnight.</p>
				<p>Charlotte slept soundly for the first time in years. She went seven days without a seizure. Over time, the seizures dropped from thousands a month to just a few. After not speaking for six months, she started talking again.</p>
				<p>CBD wasn&rsquo;t a cure. Charlotte still has seizures, although Paige says she hasn&rsquo;t had one requiring hospitalization in two years. She has made leaps in her cognitive development, but, now 8 years old, she is only at the level of a 2-year-old, her mother said.</p>
				<p>But, for the Figis, it was new a dawn: Their little girl was happy again.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think she was in there anymore,&rdquo; Paige said. &ldquo;I thought that Charlotte was gone.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Paige said Charlotte now takes only cannabis to control her seizures.</p>
				<p>Despite the ongoing uncertainty over how often CBD works, Charlotte&rsquo;s story continues to show how transformative the treatment can be when it does work. She is the embodiment of the hope that has drawn families from across the country to Colorado.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I had no idea it would be that big of a deal,&rdquo; Paige said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t understand &hellip; that there were this many people who had nothing to try.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>But one thing parents can&rsquo;t do is guarantee whether medical marijuana will help their children. For some, CBD has been a godsend. For some, it has been a dead end.</p>
		<p>Despite the positive signs, Milly still worries about which side Preston will fall on. She committed to staying in Colorado Springs for a couple of months after the move to help Ana settle. But the transition had been harder than either she or Ana expected, and when the seizures continued, Milly decided to stay longer. She rented a house near Ana&rsquo;s.</p>
		<p>Sitting at her kitchen table during the stretch of days without a grand mal, Milly thinks about how difficult Preston&rsquo;s journey in Colorado has been and about how, even now, little seizures continue to shake his brain daily.</p>
		<p>Is that progress?</p>

		<p>Her thoughts turn to the moment when she first heard about CBD &mdash; in the TV documentary where she saw a smiling Charlotte Figi riding a bicycle.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Looking back on it,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;all we could see was hope and something that was helping these kids. And they were families just like us. That&rsquo;s what clicked it and made it believable.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>She paused in her thoughts.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s not believable. I&rsquo;m just saying things are not always &mdash; it&rsquo;s a story. It&rsquo;s a story. I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Another pause.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I want it to be true.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Quiet.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I want it to be true.&rdquo;</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Preston&rsquo;s birthday</h3>

		<p class="lead">On his first morning as a teenager &mdash; Nov. 1, six days after his party &mdash; Preston shuffles out of the bedroom wearing fleece pajamas with dinosaurs on them.</p>
		<p>Breakfast is his choice, so he chooses fried potatoes, slices of cheddar cheese and tortilla chips. Milly lights a vanilla-scented votive candle to sing happy birthday to him, and, on the third try, Preston huffs in and blows out the flame.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo; Preston&rsquo;s speech therapist, Beth Clancy, asks him as she prepares for an early session.</p>
		<p>Preston looks at her sheepishly.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Preston,&rdquo; Milly coaxes, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve been practicing this. How old are you?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Two?&rdquo; he says.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;How. Old. Are. You?&rdquo; Milly asks again.</p>
		<p>There&rsquo;s a glimmer in his eyes.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Thuh,&rdquo; he starts, &ldquo;EEN!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Thirteen.</p>
		<p>The age of seventh grade &mdash; the age, for most kids, of algebra class and essay assignments on &ldquo;The Call of the Wild&rdquo; and first awkward school dances.</p>
		<p>For Preston, speech therapy this morning begins with an iPad game to identify colors and animals.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Preston, what says, &lsquo;Meow&rsquo;?&rdquo; Beth asks.</p>
		<p>He doesn&rsquo;t answer.</p>

				<h3 class="subheading">Medical marijuana caregivers in legal limbo in Colorado</h3>

				<p class="lead">In mid-September, Jason Cranford sat enraged before the nine members of the Colorado Board of Health.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;These children are in wheelchairs!&rdquo; he shouted, gesturing backward. &ldquo;Do you not see this?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Dozens of families filled the rows behind him, evidence of the patient population that has made Cranford the second-largest provider of CBD to kids in Colorado. The Board of Health was meeting to consider putting <a title="Colorado medical-marijuana caregiver rules could pinch young patients" href="http://www.denverpost.com/marijuana/ci_26448507/colorado-medical-marijuana-caregiver-rules-could-pinch-young">a cap on the number of patients</a> that medical marijuana caregivers, like Cranford, can serve.</p>
				<p>But at the start of the meeting, state health department officials had dropped a bombshell: No matter what the board&rsquo;s decision, all of the families in the room &mdash; including Ana Watson and her son, Preston &mdash; were obtaining CBD illegally from Cranford.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I saw a serious situation, and I stepped up,&rdquo; Cranford continued. &ldquo;Just to be blunt and frank, if you pass this, I&rsquo;m not going to stop doing this. You&rsquo;ll have to put me in handcuffs.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Colorado&rsquo;s laws for marijuana providers are like an onion made out of bubble gum: There are many layers, and each one is sticky.</p>
				<p>Recreational marijuana stores operate under different rules from medical marijuana shops. Medical marijuana caregivers, who are supposed to provide more personalized attention, have different rules, too.</p>
				<p>The state&rsquo;s largest CBD provider, the Stanley brothers, sell their Charlotte&rsquo;s Web product to families through their medical marijuana dispensary. Cranford also owns a dispensary &mdash; and he has developed <a title="Cranfords debuts machine-rolled cannabis cigarettes in Colorado" href="http://www.thecannabist.co/2014/04/28/cannabis-cigarettes-marijuana-cranfords/10651/">a line of marijuana cigarettes</a> for the commercial market.</p>
				<p>But Cranford&rsquo;s experience with a young cancer patient in 2009 made him a CBD evangelist, and he decided to provide for his neediest patients as a caregiver.</p>
				<p>If he sold the CBD oil through his dispensary, patients would have to pay sales tax, plus all the included costs to cover the many licensing, security and production expenses that go with operating a medical marijuana business. By operating out of his home, he said he was initially able to provide CBD on a pay-as-you-can basis.</p>
				<p>At the hearing, families lined up to support Cranford.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;The parents I talk to, as soon as they hear costs come out, they start crying,&rdquo; said Jan&eacute;a Cox, whose daughter, Haleigh, uses oil from a marijuana plant Cranford named Haleigh&rsquo;s Hope.</p>
				<p>Cox helped set up the Flowering Hope Foundation to support Cranford&rsquo;s patients. Appointments to meet with Cranford are booked eight weeks in advance, and his patient count has swelled with both families on the waiting list for Charlotte&rsquo;s Web and families who have used Charlotte&rsquo;s Web but want to try something different.</p>
				<p>State health department officials, though, worry that large-scale caregivers violate the spirit of the law. With Cranford, they have a more specific concern. According to their reading of Colorado law, the only people who can serve as caregivers to young medical marijuana patients are their parents.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;A parent cannot delegate the primary caregiver role to another caregiver,&rdquo; the health department&rsquo;s Dana Erpelding said at September&rsquo;s Board of Health hearing.</p>
				<p>The announcement &mdash; the first time the health department had ever expressed such a concern &mdash; baffled Cranford.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Do these kids have to go through my center?&rdquo; he asked. Cranford&rsquo;s dispensary is in Rifle, hours west of where many of his patients live. And state rules for marijuana stores would make it impossible to transfer his CBD plants into his store&rsquo;s inventory.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t act as a caregiver for anyone but your own children,&rdquo; said Larry Wolk, the health department&rsquo;s executive director.</p>
				<p>But Wolk said the health department is not an enforcement agency. Even if Cranford&rsquo;s CBD operation does violate the law, it would be up to the police to take action.</p>
				<p>After the hearing, Cranford and the parents <a title="Young Colorado medical marijuana patients in limbo after board vote" href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_26546570/young-colorado-medical-marijuana-patients-limbo-after-board">remained confused</a>.</p>
				<p>Finally, Jan&eacute;a Cox said, &ldquo;So, we&rsquo;re going to keep rocking the way we have been.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>And Cranford nodded.</p>

		<p>Next comes Mr. Potato Head, where Preston puts the eyes where the nose should go, the nose where the mouth should go and the arms on backward. But Clancy is encouraged. Despite the mistakes, Preston is focusing on the tasks longer than he used to. He&rsquo;s listening to instructions, too.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he says when she asks him a question.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s progress happening,&rdquo; she tells Milly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s there.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>But the grand mals are also there again, hitting almost every afternoon the week between his party and his birthday, causing Ana to run low on rescue medicine. Later in the day, she&rsquo;s watching Preston closely for blinky seizures when her phone rings. She puts it on speaker.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Happy birthday, darling!&rdquo; a voice bursts from the phone.</p>
		<p>It&rsquo;s a former nurse of Preston&rsquo;s from North Carolina, calling to check on a patient who had long ago felt like a grandson to her.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Are you having a good birthday?&rdquo; she asks Preston.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Talk to her,&rdquo; Ana urges him.</p>
		<p>But Preston just smiles, and soon the conversation shifts.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; the nurse asks, &ldquo;how&rsquo;s he doing?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Ana adopts a measured tone.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been doing OK,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been having some seizures in the afternoon. But the mornings are good.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>What if this is just Preston&rsquo;s life?</p>
		<p>For the past couple of months, when things were looking up, Ana would occasionally share an inspirational quote with friends online.</p>

				<h3 class="subheading">Colorado brothers are at the center of medical marijuana boom</h3>

				<p class="lead">At the brand-new office and lab space for the makers of Charlotte&rsquo;s Web, photos of smiling children rest on the floor, waiting to be hung.</p>
				<p>Three dozen lab employees &mdash; with more being hired &mdash; work with sophisticated equipment to produce standardized formulations of CBD oil. In another room, hundreds of tiny marijuana plants take root, part of a breeding project the brothers behind Charlotte&rsquo;s Web hope will yield new cannabis products that can do for other diseases what they&rsquo;ve already done for epilepsy.</p>
				<p>At this new facility in Boulder, Joel Stanley is unapologetic about his organization&rsquo;s ambitions.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;How else are we going to take care of hundreds of thousands of people unless we build an industry around this?&rdquo; he says.</p>
				<p>But those same ambitions have increasingly led to conflict and to one notable misstep. Today, the organization shows both the optimism and the conflict of the CBD boom.</p>
				<p>A charismatic clan of seven brothers, the Stanleys have often found themselves near the spotlight during the five-year history of Colorado&rsquo;s medical marijuana industry. In 2012, the brothers starred in a reality TV show called &ldquo;American Weed.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>But it was after Joel met Paige Figi in early 2012 &mdash; and agreed to provide Figi&rsquo;s daughter, Charlotte, with CBD oil &mdash; that began their period of greatest renown. Figi and another mom, Heather Jackson, soon formed a group called the Realm of Caring, which supports families using Charlotte&rsquo;s Web.</p>
				<p>As attention around CBD grew, the waiting list for Charlotte&rsquo;s Web ballooned to more than 10,000 names.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;To have all those people who need help and waiting,&rdquo; brother Jared Stanley said last summer, &ldquo;that is really difficult.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>So the Stanleys decided to go outside the medical marijuana system. Because some of the Stanleys&rsquo; marijuana strains can be grown with below 0.3 percent THC, they qualify as <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip tip-top radius" title="A form of cannabis plant. Hemp is generally known for its industrial uses &mdash; making rope or fabrics from its fibrous stalks &mdash; or for its seeds, which contain at most trace amounts of THC and are found in food products. Under Colorado law, hemp is classified as any marijuana plant below 0.3 percent THC. That means medical marijuana growers can cultivate high-CBD, low-THC strains as hemp, then harvest the buds for use in making CBD oil. Though Congress has recently passed a law expanding hemp research programs, the Drug Enforcement Administration considers it illegal to grow hemp in the United States for human consumption. Non-consumable hemp products or hemp products with at most trace amounts of THC are allowed to be imported into the United States, though.">hemp</span> under Colorado&rsquo;s laws for marijuana legalization. So, last summer, the Stanleys <a title="Charlotte's Web medical cannabis soon to be widely available to Colorado children" href="http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/charlottes-web-medical-cannabis-soon-to-be-widely-available-to-colorado-children">planted 17 acres of cannabis plants</a> in eastern Colorado.</p>
				<p>More ambitiously, the Stanleys and the Realm of Caring began telling patients that they could soon ship CBD to all 50 states, based on an interpretation of a federal law that makes certain hemp products legal in the United States.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not encouraging people to move here any longer,&rdquo; Joel Stanley said last spring.</p>
				<p>After the crop&rsquo;s October harvest, though, the Stanleys received a new legal interpretation. In an e-mail to those on the Charlotte&rsquo;s Web waiting list in late October, Joel Stanley and Heather Jackson announced that they would not ship Charlotte&rsquo;s Web this year because doing so could be illegal. Families who had been waiting anxiously at home would now have to move to Colorado.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I just wanted to start out by apologizing for telling you that we could do something that we eventually were not able to do,&rdquo; Jackson said during <a title="CW Hemp Oil Update" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3ccjge7_0">a subsequent webcast question-and-answer session</a>.</p>
				<p>Stanley said the group still expects to take <a title="More than 3,000 new patients will soon have access to Charlotte’s Web" href="http://www.thecannabist.co/2014/10/31/charlottes-web-wait-list-cbd/22231/">3,000 patients off its waiting list</a>.</p>
				<p>The misstep is emblematic of the complications that have grown along with the Stanleys&rsquo; profile.</p>
				<p>Their bank last summer closed the accounts for Stanley Brothers Social Enterprises, the parent company for the family&rsquo;s dispensaries, after reading in news stories that the brothers are in the marijuana business. Thieves tried to break into the Teller County greenhouse where they grow some of their Charlotte&rsquo;s Web plants. And the brothers say they are nearly broke trying to keep the business running while providing marijuana oil as cheaply as they can to young patients.</p>
				<p>In all written materials produced by the Realm of Caring, the Stanleys now include a conspicuous &ldquo;TM&rdquo; trademark symbol after the name Charlotte&rsquo;s Web. Since the start of the CBD boom, two other companies not connected to the family have filed <a title="Trademark Electronic Search System (TESS)" href="http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?f=searchss&amp;state=4801:3ya9zt.1.1">federal trademark claims</a> for &ldquo;Charlotte&rsquo;s Web&rdquo; for use in alternative therapies.</p>
				<p>Jesse Stanley said the family&rsquo;s eventual goal is &ldquo;to put Charlotte&rsquo;s Web in as many products as possible,&rdquo; and Joel Stanley says he has no qualms about the family&rsquo;s investment, despite the unsettled science around CBD.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen too many people have a dramatic turnaround in their life that this can&rsquo;t go away,&rdquo; Joel Stanley said. &ldquo;That would be a horrible thing. I believe the science will eventually catch up.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Oct. 6: &ldquo;No matter how tired you are, no matter how scared and lost you feel, no matter the diagnosis, challenge or fear, no matter how hard things get and the struggles you and your child with special needs will face, you are working from a place of great love &hellip; and that will always be enough.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Oct. 16: &ldquo;Faith is about trusting God even when you don&rsquo;t understand his plan.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Then, after the recent setbacks, she posts one of the earliest pictures of Preston from his baby book.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Today is Preston&rsquo;s birthday,&rdquo; she writes. &ldquo;I am so proud of how far he has come, he is such an inspiration to everyone. He truly is the most amazing little boy ever!! We love you Preston&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&rdquo;</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">A mother&rsquo;s hope</h3>

		<p class="lead">Ana came to Colorado hoping to find something that would make her son better. But what she found made her love him the way he is even more. And maybe that was the point all along, she would say. That it might have been enough for her just to try. That she loves him enough to never give up on him.</p>
		<p>As evening nears on Preston&rsquo;s 13th birthday, Ana reaches into the refrigerator and pulls out his afternoon dose of CBD. This time, it is not the familiar amber oil in a medicine dropper. It&rsquo;s a sage-green blob of chilled butter in a mason jar. Another Dravet mom made the infused butter at her home, using marijuana she purchased at a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip tip-top radius" title="A medical marijuana store.

		<p>&ldquo;This is why I moved to Colorado, to have access to everything,&rdquo; Ana reasoned. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re far from gaining seizure control. We haven&rsquo;t done any medicine weans.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Heating up the butter, Ana draws it into a syringe, then walks up the stairs to where Preston is playing.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Let me see your belly,&rdquo; she tells Preston.</p>
		<p>She attaches the syringe&rsquo;s tip to the feeding tube that doctors in Colorado had placed into Preston&rsquo;s stomach. &ldquo;Boink,&rdquo; she says playfully when pushing the plunger. Preston totters off to continue playing, and Ana sets the syringe down on a dresser.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what that does,&rdquo; she says.</p>

		<p>In the next three weeks, Preston suffers some of the worst seizures yet in Colorado &mdash; fist-balled grand mals during which his clamped jaw is the only thing holding back his grunts from coming out as screams. Ana stops giving him CBD for a time, then starts again with a new formulation made from a different marijuana strain. She takes Preston for a doctor&rsquo;s visit and asks about the possibility of trying an experimental pharmaceutical drug.</p>
		<p>And then the seizures dissipate, and Ana&rsquo;s optimism returns. She learns she has made it off the waiting list for Charlotte&rsquo;s Web. She&rsquo;s excited to give it a try.</p>
		<p>She might never hear Preston say &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; but, on the day before Thanksgiving, she hears something almost as sweet.</p>
		<p>She asks Preston if he&rsquo;s hungry.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; he starts.</p>
		<p>Sensing something coming, she reaches for her cellphone to record a video.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; Preston starts hesitantly. &ldquo;I ... I. Want. Cheese!&rdquo;</p>
